What I Learned
Understanding the Results:

While 59% accuracy is reasonable for a basic multiple regression model, it also highlights that other factors not included in the dataset could significantly influence housing prices.
The model might not be able to capture complex, non-linear relationships present in the data.
Feature Engineering is Crucial:

Some features like total_rooms and total_bedrooms were less informative in their raw form. Deriving new features, such as the rooms-per-household ratio, could improve the model's performance.
Encoding categorical variables, if present, can add valuable insights.
Limitations of Linear Models:

Linear regression assumes linearity between predictors and the target variable, which may not always hold true.
Interaction effects between variables and higher-order relationships were not captured.
Room for Improvement:

Regularization: Implementing techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression might help address multicollinearity and improve the model's generalizability.
Non-linear Models: Exploring non-linear models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting could potentially yield better results.
Feature Selection: Removing less impactful features could help reduce noise in the dataset and improve the model's performance.
